        <h2 class="second-heading">How pandas survive solely on bamboo: Evolutionary history</h2>
        <p>An ancient fossil reveals the earliest panda to survive solely on bamboo and the evolutionary history of panda's false thumbs.
        "Deep in the bamboo forest, giant pandas traded an omnivorous diet of meat and berries to quietly consuming bamboos, a plant plentiful in the subtropical forest but of low nutrient value," says NHM Vertebrate Paleontology Curator Dr. Xiaoming Wang. "Tightly holding bamboo stems in order to crush them into bite sizes is perhaps the most crucial adaptation to consuming a prodigious quantity of bamboo."

        <p>Cactuses are spiky and rough; foreboding and strange; gnarled, Seussian, and sometimes toxic. They evoke places where people can’t survive. But when removed from those places—their native habitats—individually potted, and sold as decoration for a house, a garden, or an office, they are among the easiest plants a person can have, requiring little or no care and still looking good.</p>

        <p>Moose are similarly nimble on land. They can run up to 35 miles an hour over short distances, and trot steadily at 20 miles an hour.Moose are the largest of all the deer species. Males are immediately recognizable by their huge antlers, which can spread 6 feet from end to end. Moose have long faces and muzzles that dangle over their chins. A flap of skin known as a bell sways beneath each moose's throat.</p>

        <p>No one knows who created this miniature marvel, dubbed the “Vogelherd horse” after the cave in Germany in which it was found, but it is clear that this ivory carver spent a lot of time watching wild horses, studying their social interactions and learning their body language.</p>

        <p>What we know is that auroral activity coincides with sunspots – darker, cooler regions of intense magnetic activity on the Sun’s surface. Birkeland said that currents flowing through the gas of the upper atmosphere caused the light show; in the same way that our modern-day neon lights work.</p>

        <p>There are few places left in the world to see the sky as our ancestors did; to gaze in wonder at the celestial dome and feel the weight of billions of years of cosmic history hanging above us. Thankfully the International Dark Sky Association is working to preserve what's left of the true night sky, and they've rightfully marked northern Chile to preserve for posterity.</p>

        <p>The strawberry (Fragaria sp.) is one of the most popular berries on Nordic tables. The wild strawberries have been harvested in the wild and highly appreciated for centuries, not only for the sweet taste, but as a cure for illnesses.</p>

        <img class="first" src="./images/Snow and Nature.jpg" alt="The seventh image">
        <p>Researchers want to predict how much water we will get later in the year based on the snowpack. But in forested regions, the trees impact the calculations. When falling snow is intercepted by trees, it sometimes never makes its way to the ground, and the current models struggle to predict what will happen.</p>

        <p>Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) programmes are often used as a tool to reduce deforestation and forest degradation in tropical countries.Such programmes offer monetary or in-kind payments to individual landowners or forest users who voluntarily reduce deforestation or increase their forest-conservation activities, thereby, increasing the forest’s ecosystem services.</p>
